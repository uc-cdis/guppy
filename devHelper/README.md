# How to generate mock data and start developing in your local 

## Step.1 start elasticsearch

```
docker-compose -f ./esearch.yml up -d
```

## Step.2 import mock data into elasticsearch index

```
cd scripts/ && sh ./generate_data.sh
```

## Step.3 start server for developing server side code
Go to repo root directory, and run

```
GUPPY_PORT=3000 INTERNAL_LOCAL_TEST=true npm start
```

The Guppy server will be hosted at [localhost:3000/graphql](http://localhost:3000/graphql), now use Insomnia or Postman to play with it! 
We use nodemon to start the server, so all code change will be hot applied to the running server in realtime. 

## Step.4 start storybook for developing front-end components
Go to repo root directory, and run

```
npm run storybook
```

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) will be hosted at [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006).
